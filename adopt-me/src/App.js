// When in development mode your development server will automatically be compiled with an environment variable of NODE_ENV=development and in production mode, when you build the app this variable will be changed to NODE_ENV=production
// React has a lot of debugging conveniences built into it out of the box. This conveniences get automatically removed, when you compile your code for production (this gets removed or added based on the value of the NODE_ENV enviroment variable). The dev bundle of React is bigger and slower than production build, so it is important to remove those conveniences for production build. Make sure you're compiling with the correct environmental variables or your users will suffer.
